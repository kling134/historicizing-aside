<h1>Historicizing &lt;aside&gt;</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In her 1999 article <i>On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies</i>, Christina Haas argues against oversimplified views of technological development. According to Haas, the so-called simple replacement model and the straightforward progress model “are based on the premise that old and new technologies are separate, distinct, mutually exclusive, and easily differentiated” (p. 210). However, Haas contends that “technological change cannot be a simple replacement of one technology with another…because technology is anchored so closely both to individual histories and to cultural practices” (p. 212). As a result, some people will continue to use “old” technologies as long as those technologies continue to suit their purposes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, older technologies often serve as the inspiration for the development of newer technologies, and as a result, it is not uncommon for newer technologies to incorporate some of the same conventions associated with their older counterparts. For instance, many features that originated with print media can also be seen in electronic media contexts. The HTML element known as &lt;aside&gt; is but one example of this phenomenon.</p>

<h2>What is &lt;aside&gt;?</h2>

<p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the code that webpages are made of. The units of content within an HTML document are known as elements.</p>

<p>Since its inception in the early 1990s, HTML has undergone many changes. The specification for the latest iteration, HTML5, included several new elements, one of which was &lt;aside&gt;. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-aside-element" title="HTML5 specification" target="blank">HTML5 specification</a>, “The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content.”</p>

<p>Another way to understand what the &lt;aside&gt; element means is to reflect on the definition of the word itself—according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, an aside is “a comment or discussion that does not relate directly to the main subject being discussed.” Thus, content wrapped in &lt;aside&gt; tags can be said to not relate directly to the main content of the page.</p>

<h3>Special features</h3>

<p>The &lt;aside&gt; element belongs to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#Sectioning_content" title="sectioning content model" target="blank">sectioning content model<a>, which means that a new section is automatically created in the document outline when the &lt;aside&gt; element is employed. The other elements belonging to the sectioning content model are &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;section&gt;. Each of the four sectioning elements was new to HTML5.</p>

<p>In addition, the &lt;aside&gt; element is noteworthy for its accessibility. &lt;aside&gt; is a semantic element, which means that it describes its contents. One benefit of semantic markup is that it allows users of assistive technologies, such as screen readers for the visually impaired, to easily navigate from one content area to another.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" title="Mozilla Developer Network" target="blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, “Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make Web content and Web applications…more accessible to people with disabilities.” ARIA consists of role, state, and property attributes that can be added to markup language such as HTML. The &lt;aside&gt; element carries a default ARIA role attribute value of 'complementary,' which means that user agents such as browsers and screen readers will treat an &lt;aside&gt; element as a “supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content.”</p>

<h2>The development of &lt;aside&gt;</h2>

<p>Before HTML5, there was only one block-level element that allowed web developers to divide pages into different areas: &lt;div&gt;. This generic container can be used to group content and apply CSS styles.</p>

<p>Through the magic of CSS, web developers can style &lt;div&gt; elements so that they <em>appear</em> to be distinct page sections. However, if you remove the styling, it becomes apparent that &lt;div&gt; elements are really just part of the linear flow of the document. Indeed, that is exactly how the browser computes &lt;div&gt; elements, even when styling is present. As a result, users of assistive technologies may have a hard time accessing information on webpages that exclusively use the &lt;div&gt; element to group content.</p>

<p>The problem with &lt;div&gt; is that it carries no meaning on its own. Web developers can imbue it with some meaning by assigning class or id attributes that describe the element’s contents, but this is more for the developer’s benefit than anyone else’s—the browser can’t meaningfully differentiate between <code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code>. Moreover, web developers are free to use whatever class and id attributes they please, which means there is little consistency from one webpage to the next.</p>

<h3>New structural elements</h3>

<p>In 2007, the web standards body known as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) partnered with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) to form an HTML Working Group dedicated to drafting a new specification for HTML5. The editors recognized the need to introduce new structural elements to supplement &lt;div&gt;. They looked to the results of a <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/state-of-the-web/2005/" title="large-scale analysis by Google" target ="blank">large-scale analysis by Google</a> to identify potential new elements.</p>

<p>In December 2005, Google had conducted an analysis of over one billion webpages in order to study web-authoring practices. Among other things, this analysis yielded <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/state-of-the-web/2005/classes" title="top 20 class names" target="blank">20 of the most popular class names used by developers</a>, including several which would go on to become elements in their own right (e.g., footer, header, nav).</p>

<h3>The element formerly known as &lt;sidebar&gt;</h3>

<p>Interestingly, the &lt;aside&gt; element was known by another name for a time. According to front-end web developer <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Sep/0257.html" title="Lachlan Hunt" target="blank">Lachlan Hunt</a>, “Originally, the [aside] element was named &lt;sidebar&gt;, and it was introduced to address the common case of left and right columns, of which one of the most common names classes/ids was ‘sidebar.’”</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the &lt;sidebar&gt; element was initially intended to be used for columns of content on the side of a page. However, at some point, the scope of the &lt;sidebar&gt; element expanded to include any “tangentially related content.” Once the intended use of the &lt;sidebar&gt; element evolved, it was only appropriate to change the name of the element to match its new meaning.</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2008Jul/0270.html" title="Ian Hickson" target="blank">Ian Hickson</a>, one of the editors who helped develop the HTML5 specification, favored the &lt;sidebar&gt; name change because he “wanted to avoid being too specific about the presentation in the name.” Whereas the &lt;sidebar&gt; element prescribed a format for displaying tangentially related content, the &lt;aside&gt; element leaves the matter of presentation up to the web developer.</p>

<h3>How was &lt;aside&gt; shaped by print media?</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-aside-element" title="HTML5 specification" target="blank">HTML5 specification</a> makes reference to print media’s influence on the development of the &lt;aside&gt; element. It points out that tangentially related content is “often represented as sidebars in printed typography.” Indeed, open any newspaper, magazine, or textbook, and you are likely to encounter supplemental information of some kind displayed in a box off to the side. This convention carried over into webpage design, which undoubtedly set the stage for the introduction of the &lt;aside&gt; element.</p>

<p>Consider the following examples of tangentially related content inserted in the middle of an article in Time magazine. The first example shows an enlarged quotation pulled from the body of the article. In print media, this is known as a pull quote.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Images/timemagpullquote.jpg" width="600" height="700" alt="Pull quote in Time magazine">
</figure>

<p>In the second example, the middle column contains statistical data relevant to the theme of the article. This information can be considered tangentially related because while it is nice to know, it is not crucial to the reader's understanding of the overall story.</p>

<h2>Using &lt;aside&gt;</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-aside-element" title="HTML5 specification" target="blank">HTML5 specification</a> recommends that the &lt;aside&gt; element be used for “typographical effects like pull quotes or sidebars, for advertising, for groups of nav elements, and for other content that is considered separate from the main content of the page.” The specification also explicitly discourages developers from using the &lt;aside&gt; element for parentheticals “since those are part of the main flow of the document.”</p>

<p>One organization that has followed these recommendations is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/" title="The Atlantic.com" target="blank">The Atlantic</a>. The magazine’s online articles often employ the &lt;aside&gt; element for pull quotes, as pictured below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Images/pullquote.jpg" width="650" height="625" alt="Pull quote from TheAtlantic.com">
</figure>

<p>The source code for the pull quote in the above example looks like this:</p>

<div class="rawcode">
<p><code>&lt;aside class="pullquote instapaper_ignore"&gt;<br>
  “Did we all believe Clinton would win because of bad data, or did we ignore bad data because we believed Clinton would win?”<br>
  &lt;/aside&gt;</code></p>
</div>

<p>The Atlantic also uses the &lt;aside&gt; element to display links to related stories, like so:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="Images/relatedstory.jpg" width="775" height="575" alt="Related Story from TheAtlantic.com">
</figure>

<p>The source code for the above link to a related story is much more convoluted, so it has been condensed here for ease of legibility:</p>

<div class="rawcode">
<p><code>
  &lt;aside class="callout"...&gt;<br>
  &lt;hr&gt;<br>
  &lt;h4&gt;Related Story&lt;/h4&gt;<br>
    &lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;<br>
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/international/archive/2016/11/trump-election-foreign-policy/505934/"...&gt;How Donald Trump Could Change the World&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br>
    &lt;hr&gt;<br>
  &lt;/aside&gt;
</code></p>
</div>

<p>Thus, &lt;aside&gt; can be used to achieve some of the same typographical effects seen in print media (e.g. pull quotes), and it can also be used for features unique to electronic media (e.g. related reading links).</p>

<h3>Best practices</h3>

<p>In keeping with the recommendations set forth in the HTML5 specification, web developers should consider using &lt;aside&gt; to encapsulate “tangentially related content.” This might include definitions, background information, or pull quotes, among other possibilities.</p>

<p>In addition, developer <a href="http://html5doctor.com/aside-revisited/" title="Mike Robinson" target="blank">Mike Robinson</a> writes that it is acceptable to use &lt;aside&gt; for “secondary content related to the site as a whole” so long as the &lt;aside&gt; element is not nested within an &lt;article&gt; element. In Robinson's own words, “When used within an article element, the contents should be specifically related to that article (e.g., a glossary). When used outside of an article element, the contents should be related to the site (e.g., a blogroll, groups of additional navigation, and even advertising if that content is related to the page).”</p>

<p>The &lt;aside&gt; element is still relatively new. As we have seen, some entities such as The Atlantic have already added the sectioning elements introduced in HTML5 to their web authoring toolkits. However, there are many other organizations that continue to rely on &lt;div&gt; to create the illusion of document sections. As more web developers come around to the idea of using &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt; <em>in addition to</em> &lt;div&gt;, new uses for each of these technologies may well come to light. It remains to be seen how the usage of the &lt;aside&gt; element will evolve in the future.</p>
